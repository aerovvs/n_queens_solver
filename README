N-Queen Problem Solver

This project implements three local search algorithms to solve the 8-Queen problem:

1. steepest-ascent hill climbing: attempts to minimize conflicts by iteratively selecting the best neighbor
2. simulated annealing: uses probabilistic exploration to escape local optima
3. min-conflicts: resolves conflicts directly by focusing on the most problematic queens

The program analyzes the success rates, search costs, and runtimes for each algorithm, provides a final solution for each algorithm when successful and supports testing with a large number of random 8-Queen instances.

How to Run:
1. Run the program: python3 project2.py
2. The program will automatically:
solve 100 random instances of the 8-Queen problem using each algorithm and display:
success rates
average steps
average runtimes
a final solution for each algorithm if successful

For each algorithm, the program analyzes:
success rate = percentage of solved instances
average steps = the mean number of steps taken
average time = the average runtime in seconds
